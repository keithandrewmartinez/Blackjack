4. Goal of the game is to be highest at or under 21 sum from your card value, without going over
5. If dealer has 16 or less, he HAS to hit, so you should use this to your advantage
6. Reset the game and reshuffle the cards by pushing the refresh button (if it ain't broke, why fix it?! kidding... added functionality to be added in future editions. STAY TUNED!!)
